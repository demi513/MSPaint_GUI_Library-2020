# MSPaint GUI library

## What I learned
  - **Pyautogui:** Learned how to automate GUI interactions using the pyautogui library.
  - **Tesseract:** Gained hands-on experience with OCR using Tesseract to extract text from images.
  - **OpenCV (Image processing):** The project involved capturing screenshots of the screen and processing them to extract useful data.

## Overview
This is a library that transforms Microsoft Paint into a basic GUI window.

## Features
  - **Window class:** Manages the state of a window, including tool selection, ribbon visibility, and status bar visibility.
  - **Line class:** Draws lines on the window.
  - **Rectangle class:** Draws rectangles on the window.
  - **Text class:** Creates text boxes with customized fonts, sizes, and styles in the window.
  - **Button class:** A clickeable button in the window that can trigger events.
  - **Entry class:** Captures text from an on-screen entry field using OCR. Basically, a text input field for the user.
